# html-colors-to-bbcode
A simple little program I wrote to convert colored text in html to colored bbcode text.
Only works in this specific case. This was not written to cover any cases beyond my one use.

oh and i used this website to convert an image to html:
https://www.text-image.com/convert/
i converted from the html it provides in the page source
